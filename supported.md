# Supported Boards
Testing:
- Arduino Uno Rev 3

*Should* work with:
- Arduino Pro 5V
- Arduino Pro Mini 5V
- Arduino Nano
- Arduino Duemilanove

*Might* work with:
- Mega 2560 (seems likely, but needs testing)
- Arduino Leonardo
- Arduino YÃºn

# Supported Servos
Testing:
- AX-12A
- AX-18A

Upcoming:
- XL-320

Once the core v1 (AX) and v2 (XL) protocols are up and running, it should be trivial to add support for additional servos (such as the MX series) which use those protocols.
